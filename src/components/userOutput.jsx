                JavaScript is the major driver of modern web applications since it's the only programming language
                which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps.
                You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.
                But using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app
                with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.

        </div>
